# LearnNest Enhanced

A comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) built with Flask, featuring course management, student enrollment, assignments, forums, and real-time chat capabilities.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Features
- **Multi-role System**: Admin, Instructor, and Student roles with isolated permissions
- **Course Management**: Create, edit, and manage courses with unique course codes
- **Student Enrollment**: Course-specific registration with instructor approval workflow

- **Database**: SQLite with WAL mode
- **Real-time**: Flask-SocketIO with Eventlet
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini AI for feedback and grading
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login
- **Caching**: Flask-Caching
- **Production Server**: Gunicorn with Eventlet workers

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LumiereXFtw/learnnest_enhanced.git
   cd learnnest_enhanced
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your configuration
   ```

4. **Initialize Database**
   ```bash
   python -c "from app import init_db; init_db()"
   ```

5. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   # Development
   python app.py
   
   # Production
   ./start.sh
   ```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
FLASK_ENV=production
```

### Database Configuration
The application uses SQLite with the following optimizations:
- WAL mode for better concurrency
- Connection pooling for improved performance
- Proper indexing for faster queries

## üöÄ Deployment

### Render Deployment
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
2. Set environment variables in Render dashboard
3. Use the provided `start.sh` script as the build command
4. Configure the service to use port 10000

### Production Configuration
- Gunicorn with Eventlet workers
- Optimized for Render's infrastructure
- Automatic database initialization
- Static file caching

## üìä Performance Features

### Database Optimizations
- Thread-local connection pooling
- WAL mode for better concurrency
- Optimized PRAGMA settings
- Connection reuse for better performance

### Caching Strategy
- Flask-Caching for frequently accessed data
- 1-year cache headers for static files
- Context processor caching for user logos

### Lazy Loading
- NLTK downloads only when needed
- Gemini AI initialization on-demand
- Heavy imports deferred until required

## üîê Security

### Authentication & Authorization
- Flask-Login for session management
