# 🚀 Railway Deployment Guide for LearnNest Enhanced

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account** - Your code must be on GitHub
2. **Railway Account** - Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
3. **Gemini API Key** - Get from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Push Code to GitHub

```bash
# If you haven't already, push your code to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/learnnest_enhanced.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy on Railway

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
   - Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign in with GitHub

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "New Project"

   - Add these environment variables:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
FLASK_ENV=production
```

4. **Deploy**
   - Railway will automatically detect it's a Python app
   - It will use the `railway_start.py` script
   - Deployment takes 2-3 minutes

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
