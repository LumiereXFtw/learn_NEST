# LearnNest Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### 1. **Railway (Recommended)**
Railway is perfect for Flask apps and offers:
- Persistent file system
- Database support
- WebSocket support
- Easy deployment

**Steps:**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy automatically

### 2. **Render (Current)**
Render is good but has performance limitations on free tier:
- Upgrade to paid plan for better performance
- Use the provided `start.sh` script
- Configure environment variables

### 3. **Vercel (Limited)**
Vercel works but with limitations:
- No persistent file storage
- No WebSocket support
- Database limitations
- Cold starts

### 4. **Heroku**
Heroku is reliable but requires credit card:
- Free tier discontinued
- Good for production apps
- Easy deployment

### 5. **DigitalOcean App Platform**
Professional hosting:
- Reliable and scalable
- Good performance
- Reasonable pricing

**Avoid Vercel** for this project due to:
